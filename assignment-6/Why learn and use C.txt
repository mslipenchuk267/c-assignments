It is important for me to learn and use C because it is a high-level language that
can handle low-level activities which can be compiled on a vast amount of platforms.
I have interest in embedded devices and also know that SDKs for software often writen in C.
If I want to create drivers for devices or make use of SDKs to implement APIs to 
interface between different programs, then it is very relevant to learn C.
